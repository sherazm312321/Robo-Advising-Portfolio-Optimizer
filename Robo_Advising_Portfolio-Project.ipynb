    "Our strategy is Risk-Free, meaning that we want to create a stock portfolio that has returns as close to 0 as possible (final portfolio value is as close to the initial investment of ($1 million - fees) as possible). \n",
    "*The methods and types of data we used all came from Prof. Thompson's lectures \n",
    "\n",
    "This is our strategy: (the strategy will be explained more in the code as well)\n",
    "1. Remove all unwanted stocks and months:\n",
    "    - Remove all foreign stocks, keep only the US and Canadian stocks\n",
    "    - Remove all stocks with an average daily volume < 5,000 shares between Oct 1, 2024 and Sep 30, 2025 \n",
    "    - Drop months for each stock with < 18 trading days\n",
    "\n",
    "2. After removing all the unwanted stocks, get data for each of the remaining stocks that will help us determine if they are stable and optimal for us to add to our portfolio:\n",
    "    - Standard deviation\n",
    "        - Tells us how volatile/risky the stock is, and we will look for stocks that have lower standard deviations (close to 0) to reduce the volatility and risk of our portfolio\n",
    "    - Beta to the S&P 500\n",
    "        - Tells us how closely the stock moves with the market. We want to look for stocks that have lower betas (close to 0 in absolute value) because it will mean that the stock's movements aren't very correlated with the market, and don't particularly go up or down when the market moves\n",
    "    - Expected Monthly Returns\n",
    "        - Tells us what percentage return we should expect to see per month. We want to look for stocks that have lower expected monthly returns (close to 0 in absolute value) because we want a portfolio that gives as close to 0% returns as possible\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Now that we have data for all the stocks, combine the data into a score and rank the stocks on the 3 metrics, getting a sorted list in order of which stocks are the best to invest in\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Based on the ranking, add stocks to the portfolio one at a time \n",
    "    - We want 25 stocks (maximum amount allowed) at the end, with each being weighed equally because we want to diversify as much as possible and not get hurt by company-based scandals or industry-wide down/upturns. \n",
    "    - First, add the large and small-cap stocks that rank the highest in the scores\n",
    "    - We don't just choose the top 25 stocks based on the ranking because that ranking doesn't take into account how correlated each stock is to one another\n",
    "    - For example, if the top 25 stocks are all in the same industry, then they will probably be highly correlated with each other, making our portfolio not very diversified\n",
    "    - This is why we will add the stocks one at a time and making sure that each additional stock is not too correlated with the stocks already in the portfolio\n",
    "    - For each of the next stocks (going through the stocks based on their rankings):\n",
    "        - If there are already 10 (0.4 x 25) stocks in the portfolio that are in the same industry, then skip\n",
    "        - Get the average correlation between them and each of the existing stocks already in the portfolio\n",
    "        - If it’s below a certain threshold, then add it to the portfolio\n",
    "        - For the first few stocks, we will make the threshold higher/more lenient since there are fewer stocks to compare it to\n",
    "        - Later on, if we have already chosen a few of our stocks, we will reduce the threshold, since if the average correlation for a stock is still high, then it means that it's strongly correlated with many of the stocks already in the portfolio, which is not optimal\n",
    "        - If there are already 25 stocks, then break out the loop/stop\n",
    "        - Change the correlation thresholds and run through the loop again, adding one stock at a time to an empty portfolio\n",
    "\n",
    "    - After every iteration, we will have a portfolio of stocks. (If the portfolio has fewer than 25 stocks, skip this part)\n",
    "    - We will find the expected daily return of that portfolio, and if the absolute value of the return is lower than that of our current best portfolio (closer to 0), then this becomes the new best portfolio\n",
    "    - After all possible correlation thresholds are gone through, we will have the most optimal portfolio\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Purchase the 25 stocks in the portfolio\n",
    "    - Give equal (4%) weighting to each stock\n",
    "    - Deduct fees for purchasing, either 2.15 USD flat or 0.001 USD per share purchased (whichever is smaller)\n"

    "1. Some tickers in the file were in lowercase instead of uppercase\n",

    "4. Although our original submission already dealt with duplicate tickers that had the exact same name, this new ticker file had some tickers that were the same stock, but in different markets. The assignment document doesn't say anything against having a portfolio with both SHOP.TO and SHOP, for example, but we still treated it as a duplicate in this resubmission and removed one of them just to be sure.\n",

    "This output shows the standard deviation of each stock. Clearly, some of the stocks have way higher standard deviations than others. For example, AXTI has a standard deviation of 0.25, which is much higher than BLK, with a standard deviation of 0.04. This means that BLK is less risky/volatile than AXTI, making it a better candidate for the portfolio. So, later on, when we rank the stocks, BLK will be ranked higher than AXTI because of its low standard deviation"

    "Each stock has been ranked on the 3 metrics now, so we have to find a way to combine those rankings in the 3 metrics into one metric. We did this by normalizing each of the rankings in the 3 metrics, meaning the stock ranked the lowest in a metric will get a score of 0, and the stock ranked the highest will get a score of 1, and all the other stocks are between 0 and 1. Importantly, this score keeps the magnitude of the stock in each of the metrics: if two stocks both had very high monthly returns, their scores might be 0.999 and 1 rather than a flat increment. So, if one stock has significantly lower returns than every other stock, it will be rewarded proportionally. The 0-1 scores for each metric are added together to get one final score between 0 and 3, and the stocks will be sorted in ascending order based on their final score. If a stock has low returns, low beta, and low standard deviation, then it is likely that it will be at the front of the list (good score)"

For example, the best scoring stock, PFE, had scores < 0.1 for all 3 metrics, while the worst scoring stock, AXTI, had scores > 0.75 for all 3 metrics. For SHOP.TO, it got the worst score (1) for both expected monthly returns and beta, but only had a 0.49 for standard deviation. This means that although Shopify has extremely high returns and moves more extremely than the market, its volatility/risk is not as high as some of the other stocks, making it still rank second last, but not the worst stock to invest in."

    "As the code runs more combinations of correlation thresholds, the minimum expected daily returns keep going down until they reach 0.03%. At the beginning, the best minimum expected daily returns were 0.05%, but after increasing some of the threshold values, it reached 0.03%. It seems like for the 25 stocks, the most optimal combination ended being the top 24 stocks that were originally ranked plus the required small market cap stock. This validates the rankings that were done before, as they individually had the lowest returns/beta/standard deviations, and their combined portfolio also had the lowest returns. It also shows that these 25 stocks are pretty diversified, as all the stocks were able to fit under the 0.3 correlation threshold, so none of the stocks were highly correlated with each other. Other portfolios either had correlation thresholds that were too tight, leading to all the good stocks with low returns, beta, and volatility not having low enough average correlation to fit in the portfolio, or had correlation thresholds that were too loose, leading to too many stocks going into the portfolio that were highly correlated with each other, leading to high daily returns due to the lack of diversification.
